## Overview

This repository contains the source code for my personal resume website. It is designed to be easily updatable and printable, showcasing my skills and experience in a clean, modern format.

This project was primarily developed using **v0.dev** for initial UI generation and iterated upon with **Cursor**, an AI-powered code editor. The final product is automatically built and deployed via **Vercel**.

## Deployment

The project is live at:

**[https://resume-juahn.vercel.app](https://resume-juahn.vercel.app)**

## Features

-   **Bilingual Content:** Supports both Korean and English.
-   **Print-Optimized:** A4-friendly layout for printing.
-   **Dynamic Data:** Resume content is managed in a single TypeScript file for easy updates.
-   **Modern Tech Stack:** Built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## Development Process

1.  **UI Scaffolding:** Initial components and layout were generated using prompts in **v0.dev**.
2.  **Code Refinement:** The generated code was then refined and customized using **Cursor** to add logic, styles, and dynamic data handling.
3.  **Continuous Deployment:** Any changes pushed to this repository are automatically deployed by **Vercel**.
